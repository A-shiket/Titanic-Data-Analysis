## Titanic-Data-Analysis--

# Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival. By exploring relationships between variables such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare, I aim to understand how these factors impacted survival rates. This analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization using Python libraries like Seaborn and Panda
